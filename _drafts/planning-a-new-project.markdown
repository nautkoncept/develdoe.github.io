Planning is crucial in the early stages of starting a new project. Even though a good plan can't account for
the unexpected, it can provide us with broad milestones. We have to turn those milestones into concrete
objectives that can followed throughout the project. If obstacles arise while executing the objectives, we
simply have to revisit the milestones and rethink the objectives in line with what we learned from the ones
that didn't work. This iterative process is known by many names, but Kant Beck provided us with a complete
framework called Extreme Programming (XP). Starting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves
to add needed flexibility and remove complexity. There are two questions to keep in mind during the initial
planning phases of a project:

* **What is the scope of this web site?** The scope spans a multitude of factors, such
as the purpose of the project, the intended audience, and how that audience will
interact with the web site. Finally, the scope extends beyond the project to the
developer as well. How much time will a developer dedicate to maintaining and
updating the project instead of new content.
* **What is the scale of this web site?** The scale convers the resources required to
integrating new technologies with the web site in the future, reaching out to and
serving a large enough audience. This might involve techniques such as creating
mailing lists, which we talk about later in this chapter.
