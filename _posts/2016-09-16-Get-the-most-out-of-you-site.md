To get the most out of our web sites we should consider how to best display our content. A visitor needs go have a **moment of inspiration**. This is a term defined by Google and Amazon as the moment when a visitor is inspired by a visual to take action, which could be a sale. This could be a set of images or other inspirational content.

Another thing to consider is the posts that you make. This is a crucial part of a website that incorporates it. We need to mofify content of the post in a manner that can promote sales. A good format is to start with an introduction, followed by a brief history or some interesting facts about the subject of the post. This will be followed by some media content (such as photos or movie clips) that tells the story. This gives your posts a personal touch that differs your blog from others in the spehere. Finally link to your own work and embed it.
