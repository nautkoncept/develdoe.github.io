Planning is crucial in the early stages of starting a new project. Even though a good plan can't account for
the unexpected, it can provide us with broad milestones. We have to turn those milestones into concrete
objectives that can followed throughout the project.

If obstacles arise while executing the objectives, we simply have to revisit the milestones and rethink the
objectives in line with what we learned from the ones that didn't work. This iterative process is known by
many names, but Kant Beck provided us with a complete framework called Extreme Programming (XP). Starting
projects with a simple design that constantly evolves to add needed flexibility and remove complexity.
There are two questions to keep in mind during the initial planning phases of a project:

* **What is the scope of this web site?** The scope spans a multitude of factors, such
as the purpose of the project, the intended audience, and how that audience will
interact with the web site. Finally, the scope extends beyond the project to the
developer as well. How much time will a developer dedicate to maintaining and
updating the project instead of new content.
* **What is the scale of this web site?** The scale convers the resources required to
integrating new technologies with the web site in the future, reaching out to and
serving a large enough audience. This might involve techniques such as creating
mailing lists, which we talk about later in this chapter.

These two questions are broadly applicable to personal projects that you would like to show off, a
blog that you started to write, and even professional web sites for organizations.

To begin answering, we first need a concise description of our web site. You should layout a short
but comprehensive description of what the project will be about.

Once we have the description of what the project will be abut, we can start thinking about the
finished product that will deliver the goals outlined in the description. To make this simpler,
the best solution is to find other projects that have a description similar to our so that we
can draw inspiration from them. An alternative method is to prototype your idea from scratch.
However, if we can find another app that already does most of what we want, prototyping becomes
much easier.

Examining an already existing app, we have a few ideas about how our product should look or
function. To get a realistic idea of what that finished product might look like, we need to
advance our understanding of the project and how we approach it. Creating a simple prototype
is a great way to start modeling behavior that our web site will exhibit.

Once we have this base model of the prototype, it is easier to start adding components to it
and making more modifications. We can think of the app that we are looking at for inspiration
as a collection of features, and then decide which ones we want to implement in our product.

The scale of a new project is often small, you want to learn as much as you can about your
audience and how they interact with the web site. Scaling is all about testing and improving
on the features that your audience uses. This is not something we can prototype easily.
The scope and scale are part of a larger thought process that result in the creation of a
project specification. We create a complete specification in another article.

After creating the prototype, the last step before we start writing code is to make a list of
technologies that we are going to use. You can think ahead in terms of concrete snippets or
includes files that you could use.
