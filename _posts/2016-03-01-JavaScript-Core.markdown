This article goes through the JavaScript language and shows you things like comments, semicolon, the unicode character set, types, values, and variables.


{% highlight js %}
// Anyting following double slashes is an English-Language comment.
// Read Comments carfully: they explain tghe JS code.

// A variable is a symbolic name for a value.
// Variables are declared with the var keyword:
var x;				// Declare a variable named x.

// Values can be assigned to variables with an = sign.
x = 0;				// Now the variable x has the value 0.
x				// => 0: A variable evaluates to its value.

// JS supports several types of values.
x = 1;				// Numbers.
x = 0.1;			// Just one Number for integers and reals.
x = "Hello World";		// Strings of text in quotation marks.
x = 'JavaScript';		// Single quote marks also delimit strings.
x = trye;			// Boolean value.
x = false;			// the other Boolean value.
x = null;			// Null is a special value means "no value".
x = undefined;			// Undefined is like null.

/*
 * Two inportant types that JS programs manipulate are objects and arrays.
 */

// JS's most importat data type is object. An object is an collection of name/value
// pair, or a string value map.
var book = {			// objects are enclosed in curley braces.
	topic: "JavaScript",	// The property "topic" has the value "JavaScript".
	fat: true		// The propery "true" has the value true.
};				// The brace marks the end of the object.

// Access the property of an object with . or []:
book.topic			// => "JavaScript"
book["fat"]			// => true: another way to access property values.
book.author = "Flanagan";	// Create a new property by assignment.
book.contents = {};		// {} is an empty object with no properties.

// JS also supports arrays (numrically indexed lists) of values:
var primes = [2, 3, 5, 7];	// An array of 4 values, delimited with [ and ].
primes[0]			// => 2: The first element (index 0) of the array.
primes.length			// => 4: how many elements in the array.
primes[primes.length-1]		// => 7: the last element of the array
primes[4] = 9;			// add a new element by assignment.
primes[4] = 11;			// Or alter an existing element by assignment.
var empty = [];			// [] is an empty array with no elements.
empry.length			// => 0

// Arrays and objects can hold other arrays and objects:
var point = [			// An array with 2 elements.
	{x:0, y:0},		// Each element is an object.
	{x:1, y:1}
];

var data = {			// An object with 2 properties.
	trail1: [[1,2], [3,4]],	// The value of each property is an array
	trail2: [[2,3], [4,5]]	// The elements of the arrays is arrays.
};

/* The syntax above listing array elements within square braces or mapping object
 * property names to property values inside curly braces is known as an initializer
 * expression, and it is just one of the topics in chapter 4, Expressions and Operators.
 * An expression is a phrase of JS that can be evaluated to produce a value.
 * The use of . and [] tp refer to the value of an object property or array element is an expression.
 * => shows that is is an valuation of an expression.
 *
 * One of the nost common ways to form expressions in JS is to use operators like these:
 */
// Oerators act on values (the operands) to produce a new value.
// Aritmetic operators are the nost common:
3 + 2 				// => 5: addition
3 - 2				// => 1: subtraction
3 / 2				// => 1.5: division
point[1].x - point[0].x		// => 1: more complicated operands also work.
"3" + "2"			// =>"32": adds numbers, concatinates strings

// JS defines some shorthand aritmetic operators
var count = 0;			// Defines a variable
count++;			// Increment the variable
count--;			// Decrement the variable
count += 2;			// Add 2: same as count = count + 2;
count *= 3;			// Multiply by 3: same as count = count * 3;
count 				// => 6: variable names are expressions, too.

// Equality and relational operators test whether two values are equal,
// unequal, less than, greater than, and so on. They evaluates to true or false.
var x = 2, y = 3;		// These = signs are assignemnt, not equality tests.
x == y				// => false: equality
x != y				// => true: inequality
x < y				// => true: less-than
x >= y				// => trye: less-than or equal
x > y				// => false: greater-than
x >= Y				// => false: greater-than or equal
"two" == "three"		// => false: the two strings are different
"two" > "three"			// => true: "tw" is alphabetically greater than "th"
false == (x > y)		// => true: false is equal to false

// Loguical operators combine or invert boolan values
(x == 2) && (y == 3)		// => true: both the comparison are true. && is AND
(x > 3) || (y < 3)		// => false: neither comparison is true. || is OR
!(x == y)			// => true: ! inverts a boolean value

/* If the phrases of JS is expressions then the full sentences are statements.
 * In the code above, the lines that end with semicolons are statements. (in the
 * code below, you'll see multiline statements that do not end with semicolons.)
 * There is actually a lot of overlap between statements and expressions. Roughly, an
 * expression is something that computes a value but doesn't do anything: it doesn't
 * alter the code state in any way. Statements doesn't have a value (that we care about),
 * but thay do alter the state. The other broad category of statements is control structures,
 * such as conditionals and loops. Example below, after we cover functions.
 */

/* A function is a named parameterized block of JS code that you define once, and can then
 * invoke over and over again.
 */
// Functions are parameterized block of JS code that we can invoke.
function plus1(x) {		// Defines a function named plus1 with parameter x.
	return x + 1;		// return a value one larger thatn the value passed in.
};				// Functions are enclosed in curly braces.

plua1(y);			// => 4: y is 3, so this invocation returns 3 + 1.

var square = funtion(x) {	// Function are values, and can be assigned to vars
	return x * x;		// Compute the function's value.
};				// Semicolon marks the end of the assignment

square(plus1(y))		// => 16: invoke two functions in one expression.

// When functions are assigned to the property of an object, we call
// them "methods". All JS objects have methods:
var a = [];			// Create an empty array
a.push(1,2,3);			// The push() method adds element to an array.
a reverse();			// Anpther method: revers the order of the elements.

// We can define our own methods, too. The "this" keyword refers to the object.
// on lwhich the method is defined: in this case, the points array from above.
points.dist = function(){	// Defines a method to compute distances between points
	var p1 = this[0];	// First element of the array we're invoked on.
	var p2 = this[1];	// Second element of the "this" object.
	var a = p2.x - p1.x;	// Difference in X cordinates.
	var b = p2.y - p1.y;	// Difference in Y cordinates.
	return Math-sqrt(a*a +	// The Pythagorean theorem
			b*b);	// Math.sqrt() computes the square root.
};
points.dist();			// => 1.414: distance between our two points

/*
 * Function whos bodies demonstrate common JS control structures statements:
 */
// JS statements include conditiional and loops using the syntax of c, c++, and other languages:
function abs(x) {		// A function to compute the absolute value.
	if (x > 0) {		// The if statement...
		return x;	// executes this code if the comparison is true.
	}			// end of the if clause.
	else {			// executes if comparison is false
		return -x;
	}			// Curly braces is optional if only 1 statement per clause
};				// Note return statement nested inside if/else

function factorial(n) {		// A function to compute factorials
	var product = 1;	// Start with the product of 1
	while(n > 1) {		// Repeat statements in {} while expr in () is true
		product *= n;	// Shortcut for n = n -1
	}			// end of loop
	return product;		// return the product.
};
factorial(4);			// => 24: 1*4*3*2

function factorial2(n) {	// Another version using a different loop
	var i, product = 1;	// Start with 1
	for(i=2, i < n, i++)	// Automatically increment i fron 2 up to n
		product *=1	// Do this each time. {} not needed for 1-line loops
	return product;		// return fratorial.
}
fractorial(5);			// => 120: 1*2*3*4*5

/*
 * JS is an object-oriented language, but is quite different than most.
 * Here is a very simple example that demonstrates how to define a JS class to
 * represent 2D geometric points. Objects that instances of this class have a
 * single method named r() that computs the distane of the point from the origin
 */
// Define a consturcor function to initialize a new Point object:
function Point(x,y) {		// By convention, constructors start with Cap
	this.x = x;		// this keyword is the new object being initialized.
	this.y = y;		// Store function arguments as object properties.
};				// No return is necessary.

// Use an constructor functin with keyword "new" to create instances
var p = Point(1,1);		// The geometric point (1,1)

// Define methods for Point objects by assigning them to the prototype
// object associated with the constructor funtion.
Point.prototype.r = function() {
	return Math.sqrt(	  // Return the square root of x^2 + y^2
		this.x * this.x	+ // This is the Point obhect on wich the method ...
		this.y * this.y	  // ... is invoked
	);
};

// Now the Point object p (and all future Point objects) inherits the method r()
p.r();				// => 1.414...
